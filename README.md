# SrsLanguageTool

Simple tool I made to learn Bosnian using Spaced Repetition

pip install kivy
^ There is legacy code in the main.py file for a terminal based program that is stripped of many features if you do not want to install kivy

To add a new language library:
  1. Open languages.py
  2. Scroll to the very end
  3. language = ["word in language", "translation of word", starting weight (int)] -- repeat for as many words as you want
  (SWITCHING LANGUAGES WILL REQUIRE YOU TO DELETE YOUR OLD SAVE)
