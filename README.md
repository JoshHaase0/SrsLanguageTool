# SrsLanguageTool

Simple tool I made to learn Bosnian using Spaced Repetition. Word selection is weighted based on how well you know a word

Enter = confirm guess

rctrl = hint

esc = new word


pip install kivy

To add a new language library:
  1. Open languages.py
  2. Scroll to the very end
  3. language = ["word in language", "translation of word", starting weight (int)] -- repeat for as many words as you want
  (SWITCHING LANGUAGES WILL REQUIRE YOU TO DELETE YOUR OLD SAVE)
